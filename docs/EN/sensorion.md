## Introduction

Sensirion has been developing and marketing flow metering sensors for many years. Until now, these sensors have been used in ventilation and anesthetic devices to measure the volume of clean air administered to the patient. But apart from this clean tract, both ventilation and anesthetic procedures need a means of metering the flow of exhaled air. This is known as either proximal or expiratory flow metering. In both cases, the sensor comes into contact with air from the patient that is potentially infected with germs and pathogens. These sections of the apparatus are therefore comprised of disposable parts or hygienically sterilizable. Now Sensirion has developed new flow metering devices that are autoclavable and can be washed. 

## Description

The SFM3300 mass flow meter is a sensor for proximal flow measurement in respiratory applications such as ventilation or anesthesia. There are two versions available: the SFM3300-AW is autoclavable and washable and the SFM3300-D is single-use. The SFM3300 features outstanding measuring accuracy and robustness as well as a short signal processing time. The digital flow sensor measures bidirectional flow volumes of up to 250 slm and is fully calibrated for air, N2 and O2 gases. The special design of the flow channel results in a low dead space volume and the slightly greater pressure drop ensures more stability compared to variable inlet conditions. The sensor also features medical cones for pneumatic connection to the respiratory cycle and has a mechanical interface for a user-friendly electrical connection. Thanks to its performance characteristics, the SFM3300 mass flow meter is ideally suited for single-use proximal flow measurements in medical ventilation, hospital applications, residential care applications and emergency situations.

Like all Sensirion sensors, the SFM3300 is based on the innovative CMOSens® Technology, which combines the sensor element and processing electronics on a single, tiny CMOS microchip. The CMOSens® mass flow sensor offers durably stable and interference-free measurement and enables a very fast and highly precise sensor signal.
